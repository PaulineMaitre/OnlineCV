#### Back (API)

Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or your favorite IDEA

- Initiate the database according to docker instance IP address
The IP address in src/main/application.properties should be like :  
````
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mariadb://DOCKER-INSTANCE-IP:3306/defaultdb
````
- Add the database in IntelliJ and run the sql queries in the initdb folder :
    - first : 1_TABLES.sql
    - second : All the default entries
    (this should create the table and add the first profiles to the data base)
- Run the Application.java file, doing this you should be able to see the localhost retuning 'it works !' [API localhost](http://localhost:8080)
