#### Back (API)

Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or your favorite IDEA.

The IP address in src/main/application.properties should be like :

````
- Add the database in IntelliJ and run the SQL queries in the initdb folder :
    - first: 1_TABLES.sql
    - second: 2_DEFAULT_Entries.sql
    (this should create the table and add the first profiles to the database)
